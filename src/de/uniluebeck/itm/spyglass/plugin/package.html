<a name="AnchorTypesOfPluginsAndClassHierarchy"></a><h2>Types of plug-ins and class hierarchy</h2>

From the functional point of view there are three types of plug-ins for the Spyglass framework:
<ol>
	<li>plug-ins that draw onto the canvas, called <b>drawing plug-ins</b> (example:
	{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.simplenodepainter.SimpleNodePainterPlugin})</li>
	<li>plug-ins that aggregate data, do statistics and so on and write them onto the so called
	global information section (the bar on the right hand side of the window), called <b>global
	information plug-ins</b> (example:
	{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.simpleglobalinformation.SimpleGlobalInformationPlugin})</li>
	<li>plug-ins that do both, called <b>drawing global information plug-ins</b></li>
</ol>

As plug-ins are furthermore distinguished by semantic properties there's a convention that specifies
that plug-ins with similar semantics should be of the same parent type.<br/>
The {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.imagepainter.ImagePainterPlugin} for example is derived from
the abstract base class {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.backgroundpainter.BackgroundPainterPlugin},
which itself is derived from {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Plugin}, the base class of all
plug-ins.<br/>
In this way plug-ins are grouped semantically, which also may, depending on the semantics, result in
common behaviour implemented in the respective base class. Furthermore, the plug-ins are presented to
the user in exactly the same hierarchy defined by the inheritance hierarchy (take a look in the properties
dialog of the running application).



<a name="AnchorImplementingPlugins"></a><h2>Implementing plug-ins</h2>

Resulting from the introduction
(<a href="#AnchorTypesOfPluginsAndClassHierarchy">Types of plug-ins and class hierarchy</a>) you have
to follow some rules if you want to implement your own plug-ins:
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Every plugin must implement</b> the abstract base class {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Plugin},
		either by extending another abstract class such as
		{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.backgroundpainter.BackgroundPainterPlugin} or directly.<br/>
		In both cases, the implementor should carefully read the documentation of
		{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Plugin}. Some properties, for example the human-readable
		name of your plug-in, are determined at runtime by calling static methods of your class. Therefore
		it's crucial that these methods are implemented in every plug-in. As there's no way to force you
		overwriting static methods in the Java programming language, it's up to the programmer to read the
		documentation, since your IDE won't tell you.</li>
	<li>
		To create a <b>drawing plug-in</b> you <b>must implement</b>
		{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Drawable}. Objects are painted onto the canvas by using
		so called drawing objects (see <a href="#AnchorDrawingObjects">Drawing Objects</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		To create a <b>global information plug-in</b> you <b>must implement</b>
		{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.GlobalInformation}.
	</li>
	<li>
		In case the plug-in <b>needs metrics</b> for the node's position in order to work correctly,
		<b>it must implement</b> {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.NeedsMetric}. If your plug-in
		implements this interface the framework automatically deactivates your plug-in if there's a
		node positioner active which doesn't provide metrics.
	</li>
</ul>



<a name="AnchorDrawingObjects"></a><h2>Drawing Objects</h2>

<p>Plug-ins draw onto the canvas by adding drawing objects (see 
{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.drawing.DrawingObject}) onto their layer. Every
plug-in has it's own layer "to draw on" (see {@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.layer.Layer}).</p>

<p>The order in which is drawn results from the order in which the plug-in instances are sorted in the
preferences dialog of the running Spyglass application. The topmost plug-in will be the last in queue
to draw, therefore drawing over drawings of the lower plug-ins.</p>

Writing your own plug-in you can either
<ul>
	<li>use primitive drawing objects, which are located in the package
	{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.sypglass.drawing.primitive}</li>
	<li>or use plug-in specific drawing objects which should then be located into your plug-in specific
	package.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to write a new drawing object that might be used as a primitive since it's so marvellous that
it can be reused by other plug-ins, it might be a good idea to place it into the primitive-package.</p>

The drawing of Spyglass is event-driven. Because of that your plug-in instance needs to inform the framework
about drawing objects added or removed. Please check the following methods for further information:
<ul>
	<li>{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Plugin#fireDrawingObjectAdded(de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.drawing.DrawingObject)}</li>
	<li>{@link de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.plugin.Plugin#fireDrawingObjectRemoved(de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.drawing.DrawingObject)}</li>
</ul>
