<a name="AnchorCompatibility"></a><h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Spyglass only requires Java 6 in order to be successfully run. All libraries needed are
contained in the projects sources. So generally speaking, it should run on every
well-established OS.</p>

<p>However, there's an issue with Mac OS X. As Spyglass is written using SWT
(<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">http://www.eclipse.org/swt/</a>) and Java 6, at the
time of writing this, it can currently not be run on Mac OS X. Since there's only a 64-bit
implementation of Java 6 for Mac OS X and SWT is still based on 32-bit based Carbon
UI-Framework it simply won't run. There's an implementation of SWT for Cocoa going on which
will be shipped with Eclipse 3.5 (expected for May 2009 or later).</p>



<a name="AnchorGetTheSources"></a><h2>Get the sources</h2>

The Spyglass project is hosted on SourceForge.net
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itm-spyglass">http://sourceforge.net/projects/itm-spyglass</a>).<br/>
You can check out it's sources with a Subversion client from 
<a href="https://itm-spyglass.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/itm-spyglass">https://itm-spyglass.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/itm-spyglass</a>. 



<a name="AnchorCompiling"></a><h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>After checking out the sources there are some OS-specific project properties that must be set in
order to get Spyglass up and running.</p>

<h3>Adding libraries to the build path</h3>
The folder <i>lib</i> contains all libraries that are needed to get Spyglass up and running.
Make sure the following libraries are contained in your projects build path:
<ul>
	<li>lib/ishell-contained-libs/*.jar</li>
	<li>lib/&lt;&lt;OS&gt;&gt;/*.jar where &lt;&lt;OS&gt;&gt; must be replaced with the folder
	corresponding to your operating system. Make sure that libraries from other OS' are NOT on
	the build path!</li>
	<li>lib/*.jar</li>
</ul>



<a name="AnchorRunning"></a><h2>Running</h2>

Once the project is set up and compiling there are several ways to run Spyglass:
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><b>For Eclipse:</b><br/>
		Eclipse launch configurations are part of the project checkout and are located in the projects
		root folder and have the file name ending .launch. After checking out you should find the run
		configurations in the well known Run/Debug dialogs of Eclipse.<br/>
		If you can't find them it can mean, that the .launch file contains other project paths than your
		checked out project. In this case, simply open the .launch file and search/replace the the
		projects' paths corresponding to the name of your checkout folder in the workspace. This should
		do it.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><b>Stand-Alone</b><br/>
				Use the configuration file <i>Spyglass Stand-Alone.launch</i>. This will start
				the stand-alone version of Spyglass by calling
				{@see de.uniluebeck.itm.spyglass.SpyglassApp}.</p>
				
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>As an iShell plugin</b><br/>
				Use the launch configuration files <i>iShell Linux.launch</i> or
				<i>iShell Windows.launch</i>. This will start Spyglass as a plugin for iShell.</p>
				
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>As Ant build script:</b><br/>
		The Ant build script defines targets for Linux and Windows, for stand-alone version and for
		the iShell plugin. The resulting .jar file is executable (by running <i>java -jar filename.jar</i>).
		It contains all libraries needed to run if JRE 6 is present.<br/>
		If startup fails with an java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception try to enlarge the VMs heap space
		by adding <i>-Xmx128m</i> (128 Megs usually do it) to the shell command.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><b>Stand-Alone</b><br/>
				Simply run <i>ant standalone-win32</i> or <i>ant standalone-linux</i> to create a jar
				file that can afterwards be run by <i>java -jar spyglass-win32-standalone.jar</i> or
				<i>java -jar spyglass-linux-standalone.jar</i>.</p>
				
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>As an iShell plugin</b><br/>
				Simply run <i>ant ishell-win32</i> or <i>ant ishell-linux</i> to create a jar file
				that can afterwards be run by <i>java -jar ishell-win32-spyglass.jar</i> or
				<i>java -jar ishell-linux-spyglass.jar</i>.</p>
				
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
